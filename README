Tree_Watch_Dog Platform
=======================
The Tree_Watch_Dog Platform is an open source web/phone application for PLANTED/CUT TREES information collection and ANALYSIS, vizualisation and interactive 
mapping. The methods of reporting TREE incidents done from various sources and locations include reports that come in through web and phones where country 
citizens can report any incidents that they have seen relating to the destruction of the trees or tree planting in their regions.
For more information about the platform and use cases (case studies) visit: http://www.treewatchdog.xqdoc.com


System Requirements
-------------------
To install the platform on your computer/server, the target system must meet the following requirements:

* PHP version 5.2.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

Required Extensions
-------------------
The follwing is a list of PHP extensions that must be installed on your server in order for Tree_Watch_Dog to run properly:

* PCRE (http://php.net/pcre) must be compiled with –enable-utf8 and –enable-unicode-properties for UTF-8 functions to work properly.
* iconv (http://php.net/iconv) is required for UTF-8 transliteration.
* mcrypt (http://php.net/mcrypt) is required for encryption.
* SPL (http://php.net/spl) is required for several core libraries
* mbstring (http://php.net/mbstring) which speeds up Kohana's UTF-8 functions.
* cURL (http://php.net/curl) which is used to access remote sites.
* MySQL (http://php.net/mysql) is required for database access.

#####NOTE: Need to figure out what extensions you already have installed on your server? Here are instructions to do just that: http://jontangerine.com/silo/php/phpinfo/

Installation
------------
* ####Download and extract Tree_Watch_Dog
    You can obtain the release running the latest version  of the from [GitHub](https://github.com/wamala22/climate_watch_dog) - the files are available in .zip and .tar.gz
    
    Unzip/extract the archive:
    This will create a new directory containing all the Tree_Watch_Dog platform files and directories 
    Move the contents of this directory into a directory within your webserver's document root or your public HTML directory.

* ####Ensure the following directories are writable (i.e. have their permission values set to 777)
    - application/config/config.php
    - application/config
    - application/cache
    - application/logs
    - media/uploads
    - .htaccess
    
    On Unix/Linux, you can change the permissions as follows:

        cd path-to-webserver-document-root-directory
        chmod -R 777 application/config
        chmod -R 777 application/cache
        chmod -R 777 application/logs
        chmod -R 777 media/uploads
        chmod 777 .htaccess
        
    #####NOTE: The process of configuring file permissions is different for various operating systems. Here are some helpful links about permissions for the Windows (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308419) and Unix (http://www.washington.edu/computing/unix/permissions.html) operating systems.

* ####Create the Tree_Watch_Dog database
    Tree_Watch_Dog stores all its information in a database. You must therefore create this database in order to install Ushahidi. This is done as follows:
    
        mysqladmin -u 'username' -p create 'databasename'
    
    MySQL will prompt for the password for the <username> database password and then create the initial database files. Next, you must log in and set the 
    database access rights:
    
        mysql -u 'username' -p
    
    Again, you will be prompted for the 'username' database password. At the MySQL prompt, enter the following command:
    
        GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, INDEX on 'databasename'.* 
        TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENFIFIED BY 'password';
        Import the file climate_watch_dog.sql found in the root of this folder. 
        This will populate the created database will all the tables used by Tree_Watch_Dog.

        Open file /application/config/database.php and edit the values of array variables
            'database', 'user', and 'pass' 
        with the 'databasename', 'username' and 'password' respectively to the database that you have just created.
    
    Where:
    - 'databasename' is the name of your database
    - 'username@localhost' is the name of your MySQL account
    - 'password' is the password required for that username

    #####NOTE: Your account must have all the privileges listed above in order to run Tree_Watch_Dog on your webserver.

    Now you can point your browser to the base url of your website: (e.g. http://www.example.com).
